### **Research Topic Proposal**

**Title:** _(Choose a concise, descriptive title for your project.)_  
Example: "AI-Powered Facial Recognition for Automated Attendance Systems"

**1. Introduction & Background**  
Provide a brief introduction to the problem you aim to solve.  
Example:  
"Traditional attendance tracking methods, such as manual registers or RFID-based systems, are time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. This project explores the application of AI-based facial recognition to automate attendance tracking, improving efficiency and reducing fraud."

**2. Problem Statement**  
Clearly define the issue your research addresses.  
Example:  
"The current attendance tracking methods used in educational institutions and workplaces require manual intervention, leading to inefficiencies. A secure, automated system using facial recognition can streamline the process while ensuring accuracy."

**3. Objectives**  
State the main goals of your project. Example objectives:

- Develop a facial recognition model for attendance tracking.
- Implement the system using Next.js for frontend and TensorFlow.js for real-time detection.
- Ensure data privacy and security while storing attendance records.
- Evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the system.

**4. Methodology**  
Describe the approach you will take to complete the project.  
Example:

- **Data Collection:** Capture facial images for training a recognition model.
- **Model Development:** Use TensorFlow.js to build a real-time facial recognition system.
- **System Implementation:** Develop a web-based attendance system using Next.js.
- **Testing & Evaluation:** Measure accuracy, speed, and reliability.

**5. Expected Outcomes**  
Mention what results you anticipate.  
Example:

- A fully functional AI-driven attendance tracking system.
- Improved efficiency compared to traditional methods.
- A report on the accuracy and performance of the system.

**6. Tools & Technologies**  
List the key tools and frameworks you plan to use.  
Example:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow.js, OpenCV
- **Database:** Firebase or PostgreSQL

**7. Timeline & Deliverables**  
Provide a rough breakdown of phases and expected completion times. Example:

- **Week 1-2:** Research and data collection
- **Week 3-4:** Model development and testing
- **Week 5-6:** System integration and UI development
- **Week 7-8:** Final testing and documentation

**8. Challenges & Considerations**  
Mention potential difficulties and how you plan to handle them.  
Example:

- Ensuring high accuracy in varying lighting conditions.
- Addressing privacy concerns related to facial recognition.

**9. Conclusion**  
Summarize why this project is important and how it contributes to the field.
